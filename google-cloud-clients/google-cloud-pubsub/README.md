About Google Cloud Pub/Sub
--------------------------

[Google Cloud Pub/Sub][cloud-pubsub] is designed to provide reliable,
many-to-many, asynchronous messaging between applications. Publisher
applications can send messages to a topic and other applications can
subscribe to that topic to receive the messages. By decoupling senders and
receivers, Google Cloud Pub/Sub allows developers to communicate between
independently written applications.

See the [Google Cloud Pub/Sub docs][cloud-pubsub-quickstart] for more details on how to activate
Cloud Pub/Sub for your project.

See the [Pub/Sub client library docs][pubsub-client-lib-docs] to learn how to interact with the
Cloud Pub/Sub using this Client Library.

Getting Started
---------------
#### Prerequisites
For this tutorial, you will need a
[Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) project with the Pub/Sub API
enabled. You will need to [enable billing](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158867?hl=en) to
use Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
[Follow these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) to get your
project set up. You will also need to set up the local development environment by [installing the
Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) and running the following commands in command line:
`gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project [YOUR PROJECT ID]`.

#### Installation and setup
You'll need to obtain the `google-cloud-pubsub` library.  See the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section
to add `google-cloud-pubsub` as a dependency in your code.

#### Creating an authorized service object
To make authenticated requests to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, you must create a service object with
credentials. You can then make API calls by calling methods on the Pub/Sub service object. The
simplest way to authenticate is to use
[Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials).
These credentials are automatically inferred from your environment.

For other authentication options, see the
[Authentication](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java#authentication) page.

#### Creating a topic
With Pub/Sub you can create topics. A topic is a named resource to which messages are sent by
publishers. Add the following imports at the top of your file:

```java
import com.google.cloud.pubsub.v1.TopicAdminClient;
import com.google.pubsub.v1.ProjectTopicName;
```
Then, to create the topic, use the following code:

```java
ProjectTopicName topic = ProjectTopicName.of("test-project", "test-topic");
try (TopicAdminClient topicAdminClient = TopicAdminClient.create()) {
  topicAdminClient.createTopic(topic);
}
```

#### Publishing messages
With Pub/Sub you can publish messages to a topic. Add the following import at the top of your file:

```java
import com.google.api.core.ApiFuture;
import com.google.cloud.pubsub.v1.Publisher;
import com.google.protobuf.ByteString;
import com.google.pubsub.v1.PubsubMessage;
```
Then, to publish messages asynchronously, use the following code:

```java
Publisher publisher = null;
try {
  publisher = Publisher.newBuilder(topic).build();
  ByteString data = ByteString.copyFromUtf8("my-message");
  PubsubMessage pubsubMessage = PubsubMessage.newBuilder().setData(data).build();
  ApiFuture<String> messageIdFuture = publisher.publish(pubsubMessage);
} finally {
  if (publisher != null) {
    publisher.shutdown();
    publisher.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
  }
}
```

#### Creating a subscription
With Pub/Sub you can create subscriptions. A subscription represents the stream of messages from a
single, specific topic. Add the following imports at the top of your file:

```java
import com.google.cloud.pubsub.v1.SubscriptionAdminClient;
import com.google.pubsub.v1.PushConfig;
import com.google.pubsub.v1.ProjectSubscriptionName;
import com.google.pubsub.v1.ProjectTopicName;
```
Then, to create the subscription, use the following code:

```java
ProjectTopicName topic = ProjectTopicName.of("test-project", "test-topic");
ProjectSubscriptionName subscription = ProjectSubscriptionName.of("test-project", "test-subscription");

try (SubscriptionAdminClient subscriptionAdminClient = SubscriptionAdminClient.create()) {
  subscriptionAdminClient.createSubscription(subscription, topic, PushConfig.getDefaultInstance(), 0);
}
```

#### Pulling messages
With Pub/Sub you can pull messages from a subscription. Add the following imports at the top of your
file:

```java
import com.google.cloud.pubsub.v1.AckReplyConsumer;
import com.google.cloud.pubsub.v1.MessageReceiver;
import com.google.cloud.pubsub.v1.Subscriber;
import com.google.common.util.concurrent.MoreExecutors;
import com.google.pubsub.v1.PubsubMessage;
import com.google.pubsub.v1.ProjectSubscriptionName;
import com.google.pubsub.v1.ProjectTopicName;
```
Then, to pull messages asynchronously, use the following code:

```java
ProjectSubscriptionName subscription = ProjectSubscriptionName.of("test-project", "test-subscription");

MessageReceiver receiver =
  new MessageReceiver() {
    @Override
    public void receiveMessage(PubsubMessage message, AckReplyConsumer consumer) {
      System.out.println("got message: " + message.getData().toStringUtf8());
      consumer.ack();
    }
  };

Subscriber subscriber = null;
try {
  subscriber = Subscriber.newBuilder(subscription, receiver).build();
  subscriber.addListener(
    new Subscriber.Listener() {
      @Override
      public void failed(Subscriber.State from, Throwable failure) {
        // Handle failure. This is called when the Subscriber encountered a fatal error and is shutting down.
        System.err.println(failure);
      }
    },
    MoreExecutors.directExecutor());
  subscriber.startAsync().awaitRunning();
  //...
} finally {
  if (subscriber != null) {
    subscriber.stopAsync();
  }
}
```
#### Complete source code

In [CreateTopicAndPublishMessages.java](../../google-cloud-examples/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/examples/pubsub/snippets/CreateTopicAndPublishMessages.java) and [CreateSubscriptionAndConsumeMessages.java](../../google-cloud-examples/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/examples/pubsub/snippets/CreateSubscriptionAndConsumeMessages.java) we put together all the code shown above into two programs. The programs assume that you are running on Compute Engine, App Engine Flexible or from your own desktop.
